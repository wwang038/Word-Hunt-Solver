# Word-Hunt-Solver
solves word hunt, outputting a list of words, paired with their respective scores from greatest to least. Input map from left to right, up to down, for speed. 

Note some words are too obscure (even by word hunt standards) and may not register as words. Since this was practice for graph algorithms, TrieMaps, and collections, and comparators, I chose not to dig too deep for a more accurate word bank.
